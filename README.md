# WebGPU_game
Prototype multiplayer game using WebGPU and socket.io. Through this project I learned a lot about WebGPU development. I also refreshed my backend skills and implemented "server reconciliation".

This game is far from complete. I plan to edit and finish up the game after the fall semester. If this message is still here by December 2023 it is likely that I have abandoned this project to learn something else.

The code for this project is very bad. It will be compartmentalized, commented, and refactored when I finish it up.
