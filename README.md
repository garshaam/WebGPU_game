# WebGPU_game
Prototype multiplayer game using WebGPU and socket.io. Through this project I learned a lot about WebGPU development. I also refreshed my backend skills and implemented "server reconciliation".

This game is far from complete. I plan to edit and finish up the game in the future. Initially I planned to do so after the Fall 2023 semester but I am currently focusing on other projects.

The code for this project is very bad. It will be compartmentalized, commented, and refactored when I finish it up.

## How to run
After cloning repository, run the following commands

npm install
node ./Server.js

load http://localhost:50000 in your browser and voila.
